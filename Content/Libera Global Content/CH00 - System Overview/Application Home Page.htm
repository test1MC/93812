        <p>The <span class="LIB_Italic">Application Home Page</span> is the first screen that you encounter upon logging into the system. Depending on system access and system setup, the <span class="LIB_Italic">Application Home Page</span> displays different content for different users.</p>
        <p>Some users will see more options than others and some users will see less. If you don’t have access to an option that you believe you should have access to, please contact your Supervisor or System Administrator for assistance.</p>
        <p>Each of the options on the <span class="LIB_Italic">Application Home Page</span> has a specific <span class="LIB_Italic">Pre-Defined Query</span> (PDQ) linked to it, so when the option is selected, the system launches the associated <span class="LIB_Italic">Default PDQ.</span></p>

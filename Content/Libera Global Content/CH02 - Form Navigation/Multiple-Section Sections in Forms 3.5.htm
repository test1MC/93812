        <p>Many forms have sections that allow you to add multiple sections. A multiple-section section is indicated when the background color of the section changes to pale yellow after initial data entry. Screen readers alert users when they enter a multiple-section section of a form.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the data in the section or the size of the section, the process of adding and deleting multiple-section sections is the same. For example, where X denotes the section you want to add to or delete from:</p>
        <h3>Adding a Multiple-Section Section</h3>
        <p>Place cursor in any field in the X section. Then open the <span class="LIB_Italic">Tools</span> menu and select the <span class="LIB_Bold">Add X…</span> option. Or, with cursor focus in the X section, press the hotkey CTRL+ALT+Plus Sign.</p>
        <p class="LIB_Img">
            <img src="../../LIB_Images/Core/LIB_MultSectionWithTwoSections.png" title="Example of a multiple-section section with two sections." alt="Example of a multiple-section section with two sections." />
            <br /><span class="LIB_Caption">Example of a multiple-section section with two sections.</span>
        </p>
        <h3>Deleting a Multiple-Section Section</h3>
        <p>Place cursor in any field in the X section. Then open the <span class="LIB_Italic">Tools</span> menu and select the <span class="LIB_Bold">Delete X…</span> option. Or, with cursor focus in the section you with to delete, press the hotkey CTRL+ALT+Minus Sign.</p>

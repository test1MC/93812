        <p>Press ENTER to start the search and the grid will refresh with your search results. How long it takes depends on the amount of data you are searching through and the amount of records that match your search parameter.</p>

            <li>Remember, less is more when it comes to filtering for data. Typing whole phrases often fail as the filter looks for exact matches; a single typo or a small difference in wording can lead to blank or incomplete results.</li>
            <li> Press CTLR+0 (zero) when cursor focus is in the <span class="LIB_Italic">Filter Cell</span> then press ENTER to quickly clear the filter and return all values to the grid.</li>

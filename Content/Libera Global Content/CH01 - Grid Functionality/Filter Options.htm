        <ul>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Not Set</span> - No filters set.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Greater Than or Equal To</span> - Applied to data entered in the filter cell. If alphabetical, it goes by alphabetical order of each letter entered.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Greater Than</span> - Filter results must be greater than the value entered in the filter cell. If alphabetical, the filter results would come after the value entered in the filter cell.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Equal To</span> - Filter results must be equal to the value entered in the filter cell.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Less Than or Equal To</span> - Filter results must be less than or equal to the value entered in the filter cell. If alphabetical, the filter results would come before or be the same as the value entered in the filter cell.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Less Than</span> - Filter results must be lower than the value entered in the filter cell. If alphabetical, the filter results would come before the value entered in the filter cell.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Like</span> - Filter results would be similar to the value entered in the filter cell. Like is the default option for filtering data.There is no need to enter the full name or number of the value you are searching for and it will still most likely come up. For example, enter Auth for Authorization. This will return all the components including the word Authorization.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Not Like</span> - Excludes results similar to the value entered in the filter cell.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Between</span> - Filter results would be between two values (including the values) entered in the filter cell. Select "Between" from the filter list, then enter the search values (include the word "and") and press ENTER. For example in any column that contains alpha text, change the filter to Between, then enter "I and J" (without the quotes) and press ENTER. Results will show values starting with the letter I.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Not Between</span> - Filter results exclude anything between the two values (including the values) entered in the Filter cell.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Empty</span> - Filter results show only records where the filtered cell is empty.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Not Empty </span>- Filter results exclude records where the filtered cell is empty.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Apply All filters</span> - Activates filters.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Clear This Filter</span> - Clears the value entered in the filter cell of the column selected.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Clear All Filters</span> - Clears the values from the filter cells of all columns.</li>
        </ul>

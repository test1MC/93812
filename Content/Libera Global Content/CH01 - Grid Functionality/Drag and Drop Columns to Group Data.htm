        <h1>Drag and Drop Columns to Group Data</h1>
        <p>You can "drag and drop" column headers into the <span class="LIB_Italic">Group By Box</span>. It can be a little tricky and may require practice.</p>
        <p>Click the column header of the column you wish to group. Keeping the left mouse button pressed, drag the column header into the <span class="LIB_Italic">Group By Box </span>then drop it. </p>
        <p>If you release the mouse button before reaching the <span class="LIB_Italic">Group By Box</span>, the data in the grid will be not be grouped by the selected column. This is OK, simply try again.</p>
        <p>When the mouse cursor is in the <span class="LIB_Italic">Group By Box</span>, look for a red down pointing arrow to the right of the text box that says "<span class="LIB_Italic">Drag a column header here to group by that column.</span>" When you see the red arrow, release the mouse. The title of the column header should appear to the right of the text box.</p>

        <h3>Ungrouping Data</h3>
        <p>Ungroup columns by dragging the column headers in the <span class="LIB_Italic">Group By Box</span> back to the grid. Optionally, you may refresh the application window by pressing F5 which is also known as the "make it like new key".</p>

        <h1>Exporting Grids to Other Print Options</h1>
        <p>In addition to exporting to <span class="LIB_Bold">Print Preview</span>, you may choose to export grid data into other formats. The variety of file formats and ease of exporting grid data, combined with the ability to manipulate grid data, make it possible to create your own tools to help you do your job.</p>
        <p>Every grid within System 7™ can be exported outside of the database into many different formats. Exporting to any format results in a new window opening, displaying the grid data in the chosen format.</p>
        <p>The first step to all print options is opening the <span class="LIB_Italic">Export Grid</span> menu.</p>
        <p>With cursor focus anywhere in the grid to be printed, press CTRL+E to open the <span class="LIB_Italic">Export Menu</span>. Alternatively, click the <span class="LIB_Bold">Export Grid</span> button located in the lower right hand corner of the selected grid. Hovering the mouse over the buttons provides the button titles.</p>

            <br /><span class="LIB_Caption">Export Grid menu.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A brief description of each option is listed below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Print Preview</span> - What you see is what you print.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Email</span> - Sends an HTML copy of the grid via email to the recipient of your choice. </li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">PDF</span> - Invented by Adobe©, Portable Document Format (PDF) is the published specification used by standards bodies around the world for more secure, reliable electronic document distribution and exchange.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">XML</span> - Acronym for Extensible Markup Language, a specification developed by the W3C. It allows designers to create their own customized tags, enabling the definition, transmission, validation, and interpretation of data between applications and between organizations.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Excel</span> - Format compatible with Microsoft ® Excel ® spreadsheet software. When exporting grids that include columns that display comma separated lists of numerical values, the values are converted to numbers. This happens because the grid stores the data as text and Excel converts it to a number. For example:<br /><br />A column that shows a comma separated list of user roles such as: 2,3,1001,9901 appears in Excel as 2,310,019,901.<br /><br />If you want the data in the column to not be converted to a number, export to CSV instead.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Text</span> - A file that holds text (.txt). The term text file is often used as a synonym for ASCII file, a file in which characters are represented by their ASCII codes. It doesn’t support text formatting.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">CSV</span> - Acronym for comma-separated values, another name for the comma-delimited format of data representation. The result is very similar to exporting to Text, except there are commas between each columnar value. Please note that if you have Microsoft ® Excel ® installed, when you export to CSV it will likely open in Excel. Use this option when you are exporting grids that include columns that display comma separated lists of numerical values. Grids store these as text. If you export to Excel, the text is converted to a number. Exporting to CSV doesn't convert the values in the column.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Tips.flsnp" />
        <ul>
            <li>When emailing a grid, if you can't remember the recipient's email address, send the form to yourself to access your email address book.</li>
            <li>Once you export to your desired format it's best to print preview from the export to review and change the page setup before printing.</li>
        </ul>

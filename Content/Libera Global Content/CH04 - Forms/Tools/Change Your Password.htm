        </p>
        <p>The <span class="LIB_Italic">Change Your Password</span> tool is an option on the <span class="LIB_Italic">Tools</span> menu of the <span class="LIB_Italic">File Drawer</span>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Form Fields</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Your Name</span> – Automatically populated with your name. You may not edit this field.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Current Password</span> – This field is selected by default when the form opens. Type your current password here. As you type your password only dots or asterisks will be displayed.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">New Password</span> – Type your new password. Passwords must meet the complexity level requirement set by your Agency.  As you type your new password only dots or asterisks will be displayed.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Confirm New Password</span> – Confirm your new password by typing it again.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Save Password</span> – Select this button to save your  new password. When your new password is successfully changed the following message will appear: <span class="LIB_Italic">Your password was successfully changed</span>. There are several reasons that your new password may not be accepted including your new password is too similar to your old password, your new password confirmation does not match, or your new password doesn’t meet password requirements and more. If this happens a message will appear informing you what was wrong. Select <span class="LIB_Bold">OK</span> on the message window to be returned to the <span class="LIB_Italic">Change Your Password </span>window and try again.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Cancel</span> – Select this button to cancel your password change.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you have successfully changed your password select the <span class="LIB_Bold">OK </span>button. This closes the message and the <span class="LIB_Italic">Change Your Password</span> window.</p>

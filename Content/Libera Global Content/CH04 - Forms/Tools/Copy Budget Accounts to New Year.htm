        <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Overview</span>
        </p>
        <p>Use the <span class="LIB_Italic">Copy Budget Account to New Year</span> tool to quickly create budget accounts for the following fiscal year. The tool copies everything except the <MadCap:variable name="Terminology.Allocated" /> amount and sets the <span class="LIB_Bold">Turn Account Off</span> field  to <span class="LIB_Bold">Y</span> (<span class="LIB_Italic">Yes</span>). You need to provide the <MadCap:variable name="Terminology.Allocated" /> amount and set the field <span class="LIB_Bold">Turn Account Off?</span> to <span class="LIB_Bold">N</span> (<span class="LIB_Italic">No</span>) before the new account can be used in authorizations.</p>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log on with rights to access the <span class="LIB_Italic">Copy Budget Accounts to New Year</span> tool.</li>
            <li>Open the <span class="LIB_Italic">File Drawer</span> to the <span class="LIB_Italic">Tools</span> tab.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="LIB_Italic">Copy Budget Accounts to New Year</span> option from the list. This action opens the tool.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Year to copy accounts from</span> – Type the fiscal year from which you are copying accounts. If the name of any account being copied contains the fiscal year in the Account Name, the year will be changed to match that of the new fiscal year. The rest of the Account Name will not be changed. This fiscal year must be before the fiscal year of the <span class="LIB_Bold">Year to copy accounts to</span> field.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Year to copy accounts to</span> – Type the fiscal year for which you are creating accounts. The number of years between the <span class="LIB_Bold">Year to copy accounts from</span> and the <span class="LIB_Bold">Year to copy accounts to</span> is added to the following dates on the <MadCap:variable name="FormNames.406" class="LIB_Italic" /> form:<ul><li>Begin Date</li><li>End Date</li><li>Date Expired (Payments)<br /></li></ul></li>
            <li class="LIB_Note"><span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span> If at least one account from the year to copy from already exists in the year to copy to, none of the accounts will be copied. A message will notify you which accounts already exist in the new fiscal year.</li>
            <li>When both years have been entered, the <span class="LIB_Bold">Copy Accounts to New Year</span> button becomes active. Select this button to create the accounts. You’ll receive a confirmation message regarding how many accounts were copied.</li>

        <p>The <span class="LIB_Italic">Dashboard</span> provides information related to the user's job functions and/or caseload at a glance, just like the dashboard of a vehicle can provide information about the condition of the vehicle at a glance. Information  is displayed in Items which are contained in sections called "widgets."</p>
        <p>Users can decide which information is displayed by selecting dashboard Items from the Dashboard Grouping on the Home Tab. When an Item is selected, it is displayed in a widget along with other Items that handle similar information.</p>
        <p>The data provided in the dashboard widgets is updated at regular intervals set by your System Administrator. Most of the information on the dashboard could be obtained by PDQs, but you would need to run several PDQs at once and constantly refresh them to get the same information provided by one look at the <span class="LIB_Italic">Dashboard</span>!</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>When you first open the <span class="LIB_Italic">Dashboard</span>, it will be empty. You must first choose what information to have it display.</p>
                <p>Select the Home Tab in the Ribbon located at the top of the dashboard window and select the <span class="LIB_Bold">Select Items</span> option in the Dashboard Grouping. A PDQ opens in a new window. Here you will be able to select which Items will appear on the dashboard. For additional information, refer to the <MadCap:xref href="../../CH03 - PDQs/Dashboard PDQs/Select Dashboard Items (40023300 and 40023304).htm">Select Dashboard Items</MadCap:xref> topic.</p>
                <p>The available choices are based on your user role. The available items are grouped into categories. When items are selected, they are displayed in boxes on the dashboard called "widgets" with other items in that category.</p>
                <p>You can select items to display by marking the check box next to the desired item's record. Once <span class="LIB_Italic">the Select Dashboard Items </span>PDQ is closed by either pressing ENTER with an item selected or double-clicking on it, all checked items will be added to the appropriate widgets. If no items are checked, then the selected item used to close the lookup will be added. It will NOT be added if it is unchecked and at least one other item is.</p>
                <p>The dashboard saves which items are selected. The selected items will still be visible if the dashboard is closed and reopened or if the user logs out and then back in. The items can be removed by opening the <span class="LIB_Italic">Select Dashboard Items </span>PDQ and clearing their check boxes or by deleting the widgets displaying them.</p>
                <p class="LIB_Note"><span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span> Your System Administrator may also add items to your dashboard.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Besides allowing you to choose which items are displayed on the dashboard, you are also able to arrange them on the dashboard by moving or collapsing the widgets they are displayed in.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Items in the same category will be displayed in the same widget and cannot be separated. For example, Pending Eligibility and Wait List share the "My Active Caseload Summary" category and cannot be separated from it.</li>
                    <li>You can use your mouse to navigate the Dashboard or you can use the TAB Key to navigate through the items.</li>
                    <li>To move a widget, click and hold the mouse button with the cursor anywhere on the widget. You can drag the widget around the Dashboard and drop it wherever a dotted outline appears. The Dashboard is divided into three columns: the left, middle and right. If you want to place the widget into a column that has no others, you must drag it to the top of the empty column. If other widgets are in the column, you can drop another widget at the top, bottom, or anywhere in the middle of the column.</li>
                    <li>A widget can be collapsed by clicking the minus sign in its top right corner. This will hide all items associated with its category. Clicking the plus sign will make the items visible again. The widget can still be moved around on the Dashboard as described above with its items collapsed. To remove a widget from the Dashboard and unselect all items associated with it, click the 'X' in its top-right corner. You will need to use the "Select Dashboard Items" tool to get the widget and its items to appear on the Dashboard again.</li>
                </ul>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Items are configured via the Dashboard Administration form to display different graphics per your Agency's preferences. The different types of graphs are as follows:</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Bullet</span> - Has a box and a horizontal bar.</p>
                <p>To the right of the number is a simple graph called a bullet-graph (bullet for short). This is a single bar that grows longer with the number tracked by the item, like a bullet in motion. Bullet Items display information that can be summed up in a single number, such as the number of clients in a certain status.</p>
                <p>When the number reaches a certain threshold set by your System Administrator, the bar will be long enough to reach a more lightly shaded part of the graph. This means that the item will have reached medium severity.</p>
                <p>When the bar is long enough to extend beyond the shaded parts of the graph, it will have reached high severity.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <p>Suppose a System Administrator sets the threshold values for the Dashboard item "90 Day Review Overdue."</p>
                    <p>They set the threshold for medium severity to 50 and the threshold for high severity to 100.</p>
                    <p>If there are less than 50 clients with overdue 90-Day Reviews, than the bar in the Bullet will be in the most darkly-shaded part of the graph and the Number will be highlighted in green.</p>
                    <p>If there are between 50 and 100 clients with overdue 90-Day Reviews, than the bar in the Bullet will be in the lightly-shaded part of the graph and the Number will be highlighted in yellow.</p>
                    <p>If there are over 100 clients with overdue 90-Day Reviews, than the bar in the Bullet will be in the unshaded part of the graph and the Number will be highlighted in red.</p>

                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Chart</span> - Displays a chart graph. </p>
                <p>The chart shows the current value over a period of time. You have the ability to print or save the chart, and/or move the legend within the chart. Right-click anywhere within the chart to open the context menu. The options are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Print</span> - Opens the chart into a new window with the print dialog window open.</li>

                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Open</span> - Opens the chart into a new window.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Save</span> - Has three options...<ul><li><span class="LIB_Bold">Save</span> - Saves to your computer (default location determined by how your computer is set up).</li><li><span class="LIB_Bold">Save As</span> - Allows you to select the save destination.</li><li><span class="LIB_Bold">Save and Open</span> - Opens the chart in a new window and saves to your computer.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Legend </span>- This is the Trend graphic in the chart. This options allows you to change where it's displayed. The options are:<ul><li>Left</li><li>Right</li><li>Top</li><li>Bottom</li><li>Floating - you can click and drag it when this option is selected.</li></ul></li>

                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Gauge</span> - Has an arch graphic reminiscent of a dashboard.</p>
                <p>To the right of the item name is a simple arch called a gauge. The arch fills in with color and changes color based on thresholds set by your System Administrator.</p>
                <p>The number centered below the arch of the gauge is the current value of the item.</p>
                <p>The color of the gauge is determined by the severity rating of the statistic.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Severe - Red</li>
                    <li>Warning - Yellow</li>
                    <li>Normal - Green</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The minimum and maximum thresholds are directly related to the severity settings. The minimum number is displayed on the bottom left and the maximum is displayed on the bottom right of the gauge.</p>
                <p>When the current value changes severity levels, the color of the gauge and the threshold numbers displayed change to match the severity level.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <p>The VR +/- Goal (22) item has three severity levels as follows:</p>
                    <p>Severe - Min Threshold (2,000), Max Threshold (500.1).</p>
                    <p>Warning - Min Threshold (500), Max Threshold 500.</p>
                    <p>Normal - Min Threshold 500.1, Max Threshold Open.</p>
                    <p>This statistic shows the difference of the number of VR status 22 based and goal set for the fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>When the difference is (1,905) it falls into the Severe level. The color of the gauge will be red and the min/max thresholds displayed are (2,000)/(500.1).</p>
                    <p>When the difference is 100 it falls into the Warning level. The color of the gauge will be yellow and the min/max thresholds displayed are (500)/500.</p>
                    <p>When the difference is 750 it falls into the Normal level. The color of the gauge will be green and the min/max thresholds displayed are 500.1/blank.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Table</span> - Displays a table.</p>
                <p>Displays a grid with the results of a PDQ. Unlike the PDQ itself, you will NOT be able to open forms or access the ECF through this item.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>For example, if the PDQ allowed you to open a client's form by clicking on the record in the grid, you will not be able to open the form by clicking the same record in the dashboard item.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Navigating a table-based item in the dashboard is similar to navigating any other grid in the system. </p>
                <p>Launch PDQ - Each table-based item has a Launch PDQ link underneath it that will open the actual PDQ the table is created from in a separate window.</p>

                <p>To see the PDQ behind an Item, double-click the Item name. This opens a new window displaying the PDQ. This is useful if you want to address an item with a high severity right away.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>For example: </p>
                    <p>Clicking on the item Pending Eligibility (02) launches a new window that displays the My Active Clients PDQ and automatically filters it so it only displays clients in that status.</p>
                    <p class="LIB_Note">Note: The results displayed may not always match the numbers on the dashboard. This is because of changes since the item was last updated. The PDQ displayed is chosen by a System Administrator.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>To see more information, double-click the Item's graphic (bullet or gauge). This opens a chart in a new window that displays more detailed information related to the statistic.</p>
                <p>On screen, the dashboard has up to three columns. However, when you print the Dashboard, all widgets are printed in one column that fits the width of the page.</p>

        <p>The <span class="LIB_Italic">Vendor Validation Dialog</span> is used to search for vendors and to add new vendors to the system. The <span class="LIB_Italic">Vendor Validation Dialog</span> is the first step in adding a new Vendor to the system. The <span class="LIB_Italic">Vendor Validation Dialog</span> is opened by activating the <span class="LIB_Bold">Search / Add Vendor</span> button at the bottom of the <span class="LIB_Italic">Data Tree</span> when viewing vendors. This button is available via vendor PDQs as configured by your Agency. Use your mouse to select the button or press CTRL+SHIFT+B to jump down to the buttons, then press the DOWN ARROW key to move to the <span class="LIB_Bold">Search / Add Vendor</span> button. When cursor focus is on the button, press ENTER.</p>

                <p>When adding a new vendor, all fields entered below will appear on the  <MadCap:xref href="VendInfo(400).htm">Vendor Information</MadCap:xref> form.</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Name</span> - Type the name of the vendor you want to find or add to the vendor list. The name you enter is searched against existing data in the system (Vendor Legal Name, Search By, Doing Business As Name, First Name, Last Name all on the <MadCap:variable name="FormNames.400" class="LIB_Italic" /> form. The search results displayed in the grid may display vendor names that do not match what you entered in the <span class="LIB_Bold">Name</span> field of the <span class="LIB_Italic">Vendor Validation Dialog</span> as a result. To find out why a vendor appears in the list, scroll or RIGHT ARROW to view all of the columns available.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">T.I.N</span> - Tax payer Identification Number. This is the identification number used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A TIN may be the Social Security Number of the sole proprietor or the Employer Identification Number (EIN). To add a new vendor you must include a TIN. Both numbers are nine digits, but they are formatted slightly differently: Example EIN:   ##-####### or Example SSN: ###-##-####. If you enter a number that does not meet the formatting requirements, the system displays a message letting you know. If you get this message, reenter the number and try again.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Phone</span> - Phone number fields are formatted to include the area code. Always include the area code when entering a phone number.</li>
                </ul>

                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Zip</span> - You can type the Zip Code or use the lookup to select from a list. Regardless of how you add the Zip Code, adding it also adds the city name associated with it. In some instances, you will find that one zip code may have many city names associated with it. When this happens the lookup will open, filtered to show you all of the names associated with the zip code you entered. Select one of the city names from the lookup by double-clicking or using the DOWN ARROW key to move to it and then press ENTER.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">City</span> - This field automatically populated with selection of Zip. However, you may edit it if necessary.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Search for All Possible Matches</span> and/or <span class="LIB_Bold">Search for Exact Matches</span> – Use these buttons to start the search process. There are two search buttons available. By default all users see the <span class="LIB_Bold">Search for All Possible Matches</span> button. System Administrators also see the <span class="LIB_Bold">Search for Exact Matches</span> button. Your Agency may choose to have <span class="LIB_Bold">Search for Exact Matches</span> displayed for all users. System Administrators have the ability to display the second button. Possible Matches are Vendors that match at least one of the fields. Exact Matches must match all fields that aren't left blank.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Once you have filled out at least the minimum amount of fields and select a search button, if any existing vendor in the system matches any of the data entered, that vendor (or vendors) is shown in the grid portion of the Vendor Validation Dialog.</p>
                <p>The grid here works exactly the same as grids throughout the system with one notable exception. Normally you can use the TAB and SHIFT+TAB keys to move to the right and left in grids. In the results grid this will not work, tabbing will move you to the next field on the form. Instead use the RIGHT and LEFT ARROW keys to move right and left in the grid.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilizing the check box next to the selected vendor opens the <MadCap:xref href="VendInfo(400).htm">Vendor Information</MadCap:xref> form.</li>
                    <li>Double clicking on the selected vendor without a check mark, opens to the <span class="LIB_Italic">View Vendor</span> PDQ in the <span class="LIB_Italic">Data Tree</span>.</li>

                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Show on Office Authorizations?</span> - When marked <span class="LIB_Bold">Y</span> (<span class="LIB_Italic">Yes</span>), this service appears in the service lookup for the <span class="LIB_Italic">Agency Authorization</span> form.

                </p>
                <p>You may specify signature rules on a per service basis. This is applied on the Service Information form, via the fields following this statement:</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">The following fields control additional signatures based on role for the life of a case. Signature Role and (Min or Max Amount) fields are required.</span>

                <ul>
                    <li>The <span class="LIB_Bold">Value Type</span> field controls the field labels for <span class="LIB_Bold">Min Quantity</span> and <span class="LIB_Bold">Max Quantity</span>. For example:<ul><li>Setting the <span class="LIB_Bold">Value Type</span> to <span class="LIB_Italic">Total</span> the field labels change to <span class="LIB_Bold">Min Amount</span> and <span class="LIB_Bold">Max Amount</span> and opens them for editing.</li><li>Setting the <span class="LIB_Bold">Value Type</span> to <span class="LIB_Italic">Unit Price</span> the field labels change to <span class="LIB_Bold">Min Amount</span> and <span class="LIB_Bold">Max Amount</span> opens them for editing, and changes the Duration to Instance.</li><li>Setting the <span class="LIB_Bold">Value Type</span> to <span class="LIB_Italic">Quantity</span> doesn't change the field labels, but opens them for editing.</li></ul></li>
                    <li>The rules are applied when users select the service for <span class="LIB_Italic">Authorization</span>, <span class="LIB_Italic">Plan</span>, or <span class="LIB_Italic">Internal Referral</span> forms. You designate when you want the rules applied by responding <span class="LIB_Bold">Y</span> (<span class="LIB_Italic">Yes</span>) to the <span class="LIB_Bold">Auths?</span>, <span class="LIB_Bold">Plans?</span>, and/or <span class="LIB_Bold">Internal Referrals?</span> fields.</li>
                    <li>The <span class="LIB_Bold">Signature Role</span> field controls which additional roles need to sign the form. The <span class="LIB_Bold">Min Quantity/Amount</span> field states the minimum quantity to trigger the additional signatures to be added to the form. The <span class="LIB_Bold">Min</span> and <span class="LIB_Bold">Max Quantity/Amount</span> fields set a cost range for which to add the additional signature line.</li>
                    <li>The additional fields relating to the projected quantity and cost are not required fields. When the calculations are not required the plan can be signed without these fields being populated.</li>
                    <li>When you set <span class="LIB_Bold">Duration</span> to <span class="LIB_Italic">Form</span>, instead of calculating the total of services for the entire life of the case or for a certain time frame, the system calculates the total of the services on the current form.</li>

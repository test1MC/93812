        <p MadCap:conditions="CO-CICMS.CO-CICMS_Exclude">Following our example above, if an <MadCap:variable name="Terminology.client_lc" /> needs dental work, but at plan development you don’t know which specific service he/she may need, you can plan to the parent service, Dental Consultation/Evaluation/Procedures Parent Service. Then later, when you are authorizing services you will be able to select from all the services linked to the parent service without resulting in a Plan Amendment.</p>

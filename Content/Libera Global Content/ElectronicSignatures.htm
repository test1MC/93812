        <h1>Electronic Signatures<MadCap:concept term="Form" /></h1>
        <p>If your Agency has opted to use signature pads to obtain signatures electronically, you or your <MadCap:variable name="Terminology.client_lc" />, will be prompted to physically sign the signature pad. All other signature functionality on the form remains unchanged.</p>
        <p>Electronic signature images are visible in form snapshots used by Print Layout, Reading Layout, form/element snapshots (used by letters, etc. when signing to lock the form contents), Save Locally, etc.</p>
        <p>When you clear a signature date on the form, the electronic signature will also be cleared.</p>
        <p class="LIB_Note"><span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span> The signature image will not be available to view (may show a red X placeholder) if you run the "Save Locally" or "Send To" options, or load the "Print Layout" and save the HTML file for later use. It is also not available in Text Layout view, etc.</p>

                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Default grid zoom percentage?</span>
                </p>
                <p>Controls the size of the font in grids. When increasing the font size the grid cells will also increase in size. This means that less data fits into the visible frame and you will need to scroll more.</p>

                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Open electronic case folder automatically?</span>
                </p>
                <p>Enables or disables opening the ECF automatically when a record is selected in the <span class="LIB_Italic">Data Tree</span>. This increases performance when using the arrow keys to navigate up and down in the <span class="LIB_Italic">Data Tree</span>. </p>
                <p>When this is set to Yes, each time focus stops on a record the ECF&#160;will attempt to load, regardless of how fast you are arrowing in the grid. The affect is cumulative. The more records you arrow through, the longer it will take the ECF&#160;to load when you reach the record that you want to see it's ECF. Filtering instead of arrowing alleviates this delay. </p>
                <p>When this is set to No, you must press ENTER or double-click the record in the <span class="LIB_Italic">Data Tree</span> to open the ECF.</p>

                <p>Enables or disables a prompt when adding a new record to a grid (provided the grid in question allows you to add new records). The prompt is a confirmation message that pops up asking you if you're sure you want to add the record. For example, "Are you sure you want to add this record?"</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Prompt before delete?</span>
                </p>
                <p>Enables or disables a prompt when deleting a record from a grid (provided the grid in question allows you to delete records). The prompt is a confirmation message that pops up asking you if you're sure you want to delete the record. For example, "Are you sure you want to delete this record?"</p>

                <p>Sets the default for hiding or showing the <span class="LIB_Italic">Filter Row</span>. You can always hide/show the <span class="LIB_Italic">Filter Row</span> on the fly as you work in grids regardless how the default is set.

                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Speak column headers?</span>

                </p>
                <p>Enables or disables using the arrow keys to move through 'spreadsheet' control on forms. A spreadsheet control on a form makes data entry fields look like they are in a table. Like a table in a word processor, not like a grid used in System 7™. </p>

                <p>Enables or disables auto-advancing to next field when current field is complete. Setting it to Yes speeds up data entry. However it only works on form fields of finite size, for example a date field or a text field that accepts a specific value or a specific number of characters. When the field is completed, ie. filled up, the cursor automatically moves to the next field. Does not work with memo fields or editable regions. </p>
                <p>Setting it Yes can cause confusion for screen reader users. Screen readers read the field label and tells them the field type. When they enter text. It reads the label, field type, and text back to them. Then automatically moves cursor focus to the next field where it starts reading all over again. It can be very confusing.</p>

                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Field Tooltip then Record Tooltip</span> - In a multiple-section section, the tooltip would display the field tooltip followed by the record title and number. For example, "Title - Client Name History 1."</li>

                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Highlight current section?</span>
                </p>
                <p>Enables or disables highlighting the current section, if the section allows adding records. When set to Yes, when cursor forcus moves into a multiple-section section, the background color of the entire section changes to a pale yellow.</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Highlight field text?</span>
                </p>
                <p>Enables or disables highlighting the contents of a field when selected (has cursor focus). When set to Yes, when the cursor moves into the field all of the text in the field is highlighted blue. When set to No, the cursor is placed at the beginning of the field.</p>
                <p class="LIB_Note"><span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span>  When all of the text is highlighted, you can easily overwrite it. If you didn't intend to overwrite all of the text press CTRL+Z before cursor focus leaves the field. This will "undo" the change. You can only "undo" the change as long as the cursor is still in the field. Once the cursor moves out of the field you will no longer be able to "undo" any changes.</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Prompt before adding section?</span>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>Enables or disables automatically refreshing a grid to show the newly added form record. When set to Yes, grids automatically refresh when a new record is added. Otherwise they don't. </p>

                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Skip reference fields?</span>
                </p>
                <p>Enables or disable skipping reference fields when tabbing. A reference field is a read-only field. When set to Yes, keyboard navigation is faster because the cursor will not stop on read only fields.</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Speak field attributes?</span>

                </p>
                <p>Enables or disables speaking a field's long description rather than its title/tooltip. The field title is still displayed in the <span class="LIB_Italic">Go To Field List</span> though.</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Speak field names?</span>
                </p>
                <p>Enables or disables speaking field names as you move between fields on a form.</p>

                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Speak form narrative?</span>
                </p>
                <p>Enables or disables speaking form narrative when a form opens. This is all of the background stuff that sighted users do not see. It's a lot of information which isn't necessarily helpful.</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Speak form section messages?</span>
                </p>
                <p>Enables or disables speaking additional information related to a section on a form.</p>

                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">View document attachment previews?</span>
                </p>
                <p>Enables or disables viewing document attachment previews within a form. When set to yes, a preview is shown otherwise the attached file is displayed as a link. There may be a slight performance increase if set to No. </p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Visual Tooltip Display Duration</span>
                </p>
                <p>Sets how long the visual tooltip is displayed. This can be used to provide a field label within a magnified view (with screen magnifier software). To never display the tooltip, enter 0 (zero). To display forever, enter -1. If set to never display, you can always turn have the tooltip displayed on a case-by-case basis by pressing CTRL+1 when you're working in a form. The hotkey CTRL+1 toggles the tooltip on and off.</p>

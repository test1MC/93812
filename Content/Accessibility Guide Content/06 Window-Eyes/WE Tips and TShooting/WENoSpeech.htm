        <h1>Window-Eyes Produces No Speech</h1>
        <p>Window-Eyes does not speak at all.</p>
        <p><span class="LIB_Italic">Current Solution:</span>
        </p>
        <p>In Internet Explorer, open the <span class="LIB_Italic">Tools</span> Menu (ALT+T). Then select <span class="LIB_Bold">Manage Add-ons</span>. This opens a new window.</p>
        <p>This window varies slightly by Internet Explorer version. If there is a field titled <span class="LIB_Bold">show</span>, open the option list and select <span class="LIB_Bold">Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer</span>. If this field isn't available, then skip this step.</p>
        <p>For Window-Eyes, in the <span class="LIB_Bold">Name</span> column, look for <span class="LIB_Bold">Speak</span>. Publisher is GW Micro and the Status should be Enabled.</p>
        <p>Please note that depending on your system configuration you may not find the add-on listed.</p>
        <p>To test if custom speech is activated, CTRL+ALT+EQUALS from down within a grid, is a good way to check for correct speech. This command will inform you of how many records have been loaded.</p>

        <h1>ZoomText Speech</h1>
        <p>While ZoomText  includes speech, it has limited functionality as a screen reader. For example, some text will not be read when using the mouse cursor, but will only be read if the field has been tabbed into. It is recommended that ZoomText be used only for screen magnification and a different product (e.g. JAWS or Window-Eyes) be used as a screen reader</p>

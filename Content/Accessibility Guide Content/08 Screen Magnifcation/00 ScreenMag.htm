        <h1>Screen Magnification</h1>
        <p>The Windows operating system provides a number of screen resolution options. These allow users to adjust their display to reach the desired balance between the size of images and the amount of information that can be displayed at once. However, screen resolutions alone often do not provide enough magnification for users with limited vision.</p>
        <p>Windows and Internet Explorer have accommodation features that may help. In addition, third party software, such as ZoomText, can be used to magnify a select section of the screen.</p>
        <p>System 7™ also provides a number of options useful for handling magnification. The scale at which a form is displayed or printed can be adjusted as needed; User Preferences control the size at which a form is shown by default as well as the magnification of other portions of the application such as the grid.</p>
        <p>No changes are needed to prepare System 7™ for use with third party software such as ZoomText as no compatibility issues are anticipated. However, like Window-Eyes, there are some hotkey conflicts with ZoomText.</p>

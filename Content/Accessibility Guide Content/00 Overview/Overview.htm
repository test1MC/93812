        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>At Libera, providing access to software for people of alternate capabilities is important. We do not simply aspire to provide accommodations for such users, but endeavor to provide equivalent access for all System 7™ users. Our software has been refined to be compatible and effective with common access tools, including screen readers and low vision aids. Most tasks that can be readily performed using a mouse are equally simple with a keyboard; often mouse clicks correspond one-to-one with keyboard shortcuts. Our support documents are written with access users in mind and our customer service representatives are trained to assist any user regardless of personal capabilities.</p>
        <p>There are still important considerations, however, regarding accessibility. System 7 features of particular importance for access users warrant emphasis. Typically, both the System 7 application and third party software need to be configured to cooperate more effectively. Also, there are occasional issues that may arise where the accessibility features do not function as expected.</p>
        <p>This document is organized in the following manner. General categories of accommodation are given with a description of how System 7 supports software in these fields. Any built-in features of System 7 available in this realm are also discussed. Following these descriptions are instructions on first setting up System 7 and then any steps needed with the third party software. Lastly, common issues are listed with explanations and resolutions.</p>

        <h1>Screen Readers</h1>
        <p>Computer screens are a common interface for computer technology. As a result, software generally focuses on visual presentation of information. This is problematic for users with little or no vision. To make the information accessible to these users, special programs known as screen readers have been created. They gather information presented to the screen and read it aloud.</p>
        <p>By default, screen readers will be able to read from within System 7™ because it outputs to the screen just like any other application. However, some set up is needed for screen readers to work effectively.</p>
        <p>System 7 is a browser application. Although it runs within Internet Explorer, it is designed to function like a desktop application, not like a simple web page. However, screen readers may act as though they are reading a standard web page. For this reason, System 7 has been designed to output extra information for screen readers to speak. This additional speech provides important details, such as the properties of a field or the status of a search.</p>
        <p>Currently, System 7 is customized to work with JAWS® and Window-Eyes. System 7 is compatible with ZoomText version 9.04.1 or greater, but currently does not provide custom speech for its screen-reading feature.</p>
        <p class="LIB_Note"><span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span> If you are using a laptop, Libera recommends that you disable the mouse pad to avoid accidentally touching the mouse pad and losing your cursor. If this occurs, press the ALT key and then press TAB to change windows until you return to System 7.</p>

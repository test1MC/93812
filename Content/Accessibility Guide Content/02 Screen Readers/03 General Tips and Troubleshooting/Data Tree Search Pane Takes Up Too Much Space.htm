        <h1>Data Tree Search Pane Takes Up Too Much Space</h1>
        <p>The <span class="LIB_Italic">Data Tree Search Pane</span> is taking up a great deal of space thereby restricting the grid view. The <span class="LIB_Italic">Search Pane</span> is the yellow section at the top of the <span class="LIB_Italic">Data Tree</span> that allows you to search the contents of the grid. It's really only helpful when you're working with grids that have parent and child tables because you can search the child tables via the <span class="LIB_Italic">Search Pane</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="LIB_Italic">Current Solution:</span>
        </p>
        <p>Set your System 7™ <span class="LIB_Italic">User Preference</span> for <span class="LIB_Bold">Show Data Tree Search Pane</span> to <span class="LIB_Bold">No</span>. After you log out and back into the system, the <span class="LIB_Italic">Search Pane</span> will then no longer be shown and more available grid records will be visible.</p>

            <img src="../../../LIB_Images/Accessibility/DTWithWithoutSearchPane.png" title="Example of the Data Tree with and without the Search Pane." alt="Example of the Data Tree with and without the Search Pane." style="width: 326px;height: 286px;" />
            <br /><span class="LIB_Caption">Example of the Data Tree with and without the Search Pane.</span>
        </p>
        <p>In the example from the image above removing the <span class="LIB_Italic">Search Pane</span> changed the number of visible records (without scrolling) from five to eight.</p>
        <p>The size of the font within the grid also affects the amount of visible records in grids. The larger the grid zoom percentage, the less rows appear in the visible window. This means you'll have to scroll more. Changing the grid zoom also affects column widths. The <span class="LIB_Italic">User Preference</span> setting that changes the font size in grids is <span class="LIB_Bold">Default grid zoom percentage?</span></p>
        <p class="LIB_Img">
            <img src="../../../LIB_Images/Accessibility/DTGridZoomExamples.png" title="Example of the difference between 130% and 100% grid zoom percentages." alt="Example of the difference between 130% and 100% grid zoom percentages." style="width: 397px;height: 265px;" />
            <br /><span class="LIB_Caption">Example of the difference between 130% and 100% grid zoom percentages.</span>
        </p>
        <p>In the example from the image above changing the grid zoom percentage from 130% to 100% changed the number of visible records (without scrolling) from eight to 11.</p>

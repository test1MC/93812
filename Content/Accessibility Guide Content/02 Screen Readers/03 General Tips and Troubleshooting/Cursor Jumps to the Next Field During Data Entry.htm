        <h1>Cursor Jumps to the Next Field During Data Entry</h1>
        <p>After entering information into a form field, the cursor automatically jumps to the next field.</p>
        <p><span class="LIB_Italic">Current Solution:</span>
        </p>
        <p>Set the <span class="LIB_Italic">User Preference</span> <span class="LIB_Bold">Auto advance fields?</span> to No. When set to No, the user chooses to advance to the next field by pressing the TAB key. When it's set to Yes it can cause confusion for screen reader users because the screen reader reads the data entry and then automatically starts reading the next field leaving the user to wonder where they are in the form.</p>

        <h1>Verifying Configuration</h1>
        <p>Here are a couple methods can be used to verify that speech is working properly within System 7™:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On the Login page, if the screen reader is functioning properly, you should hear “Application Ready.” If you do not hear this, please refer to the section, "General Tips and Troubleshooting".</li>
            <li>To check that custom speech is enabled for System 7, press CTRL+ALT+EQUALS while in a grid. This should speak information about the grid such as “Column Footer” and “Loaded X of Y records.” If you do not hear this, follow the steps above to adjust your User Preferences.</li>
        </ul>

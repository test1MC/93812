        <h1>Difficulty Locating Form Fields</h1>
        <p>The Internet Explorer Find command, CTRL+F, nor the JAWS© Find command, INSERT+CTRL+F, do not function to locate form fields.</p>
        <p><span class="LIB_Italic">Current Solution:</span>
        </p>
        <p>Use the System 7™ keyboard command, CTRL+G, to open the <span class="LIB_Italic">Go To Field List</span> that contains every field on the form. By default, when the list is opened, the form field with cursor focus is selected.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Press CTRL+T to move the cursor to the <span class="LIB_Italic">Filter Row</span>.</li>
            <li>Type a few letters of the name of the form field for which you're searching, e.g. 'street', then press ENTER to activate the filtering. The results will be only those form fields whose name contains the filtering term. E.g. 'Street - Address 1'</li>
            <li>ARROW down into the grid to listen to the available field descriptions.</li>
            <li>Press ENTER on the desired field description. The lookup will close and the cursor focus on the form will be in the selected field.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>JAWS® Hotkey Conflicts</h1>
        <p>JAWS keyboard commands generally do not conflict with System 7™. However, if they do, JAWS provides a Pass Key Through feature. To use it, press INSERT+3. This instructs JAWS to ignore the next keystroke and pass it on to System 7. This bypass command must precede any keyboard command you have defined in JAWS if you want it to use the System 7 shortcut instead.</p>

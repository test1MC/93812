        <h1>No Custom Speech with JAWS©</h1>
        <p>JAWS may speak within System 7™ but ignore custom speech even when the User Preference is set to use JAWS. Custom speech includes speech such as “read only” or announcing data entered into a tri-state check box [Y, N, blank].</p>
        <p>This problem occurs when the JAWS add-on for Internet Explorer is not configured or is disabled. If this is the case, when you visit a System 7 web page, you will likely receive the following popup message: “This webpage is requesting an add-on that is disabled. To enable the add-on, click here.” Additionally JAWS may read "Add-On Disabled" followed by the above message.</p>
        <p><span class="LIB_Italic">Current Solution (for Internet Explorer 7):</span>
        </p>
        <p>To hear custom speech properly, enable the JAWS®API Add-On:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select Tools on the Internet Explorer tool bar (press ALT+T).</li>
            <li>Go down to “Manage Add-Ons.”</li>
            <li>Go to the submenu on the right and select “Enable or Disable Add-ons” (press the ENTER key).</li>
            <li>The Manage Add-Ons dialog appears. In the center is a table listing add-ons installed (press TAB to enter the table).</li>
            <li>In the Name column of the table, locate JawsApi Class.</li>
            <li>Tab down to the Settings section. If the add-on is set to “Disabled,” change it to be “Enabled” (press the UP ARROW).</li>
            <li>Press the “Okay” button (press SPACEBAR).</li>
            <li>Close Internet Explorer (press ALT + F4) and then restart System 7™.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="LIB_Note"><span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span> If you have not used the JAWS® API Add-On before, it may not be listed in the Manage Add-ons dialog. On the Login page, Internet Explorer may have displayed the Information Bar to allow you to accept running the Add-On. Follow the instructions in the general System 7™ Tips to access the Information Bar by keyboard.</p>
        <p>Please note that depending on your system/configuration you may not find the add-on listed. For that reason, CTRL+ALT+EQUALS is a good way to check for correct speech.</p>

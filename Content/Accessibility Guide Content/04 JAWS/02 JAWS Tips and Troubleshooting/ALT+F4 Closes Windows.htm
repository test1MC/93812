        <h1>ALT+F4 Closes Windows</h1>
        <p>In many applications, JAWS® users use ALT+F4 to navigate between various screens. Within System 7™, however, ALT+F4 is NOT used to navigate between the various System 7 windows (e.g. <span class="LIB_Italic"> Desktop</span>, <span class="LIB_Italic">Data Tree</span>, ECF, <span class="LIB_Italic">File Drawer</span>, etc.)</p>
        <p>Within System 7, ALT+F4 is used for only three purposes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To close an open form or report</li>
            <li>To close an open lookup  when nothing was chosen</li>
            <li>To close the final slide of a Computer Based Training (CBT)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If ALT+F4 is used within System 7 at any other time, the command closes the System 7 window with focus. If the window with focus is the last System 7 window, you have to open it again.</p>

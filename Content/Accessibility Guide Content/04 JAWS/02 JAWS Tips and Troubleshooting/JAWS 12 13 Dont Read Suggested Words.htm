        <h1>JAWS 12 and 13 Don't Read Suggested Words in Spell Check Dialog</h1>
        <p>When navigating within the suggested words list of the Spell Check Dialog, JAWS reads, "Suggestions left paren alt plus s right paren list box 1 of 25" instead of the suggested word. As a work around, Freedom Scientific suggests using the INSERT+PAGE UP keys to read the suggested words. Press INSERT+PAGE UP keys twice, quickly to spell the suggested words..</p>

        <h1>ALT Key Doesn't Move Cursor to Toolbar</h1>
        <p>Users, by habit, press the ALT key by itself to move the cursor to a toolbar row. Then, (after having released the ALT key) they press the letter for the menu item, e.g. 'T' to go to the Tools menu.</p>
        <p>In order to access the Tools menu from within a System 7™ form, press and hold ALT, then while holding it down, press the appropriate letter, e.g. 'T'. This holds true for all menu items, e.g. File, Edit, View, Tools, and, Help.</p>
        <p class="LIB_Note"><span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span>  From the Desktop, from within the <span class="LIB_Italic">Data Tree</span>, or <span class="LIB_Italic">Electronic Case Folder</span> (ECF), the JAWS command of pressing the ALT key by itself does move the cursor to the Internet Explorer menu bar. Pressing ALT again moves the cursor back within System 7™.</p>

        <h1>JAWS</h1>
        <p>Freedom Scientific is constantly updating JAWS and with every new update or version, Libera tests its functionality within System 7™. Libera development is on-going and always attempts to stay current regarding ALL software releases that impact the functionality of System 7,  e.g. accommodation software, Windows, and Internet Explorer versions. Also, Libera updates the JAWS scripts to continually improve the interaction of JAWS within System 7. For example, it was discovered that JAWS was not reading the messages from webpage that appear within System 7.  A resolution was found and the System 7 JAWS script was updated. For use within System 7, Libera recommends using the latest version of JAWS 15 or higher.</p>

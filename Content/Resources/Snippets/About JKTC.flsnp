        <p>The Joseph Kohn Training Center (JKTC) offers people who are blind and visually impaired an opportunity to learn skills that enable INDEPENDENCE. Students gain skills to attend college, to seek employment or become independent homemakers. The program curriculum of the JKTC is primarily developed for consumers seeking a vocational goal. Individuals 18 years or older who are blind or visually impaired, have exited from their secondary school program, and want to learn the independent living skills that will enable them to be integrated into their community may be eligible. (CBVI, 2008).<br /></p>

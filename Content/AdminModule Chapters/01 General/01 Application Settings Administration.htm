        <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Description:</span> The <span class="LIB_Bold">Application Settings</span> option allows Administrators to customize System 7™ to best meet the needs of the agency without having to reprogram the system. The grid shows the name and description of the setting, grouped by category, and shows the current value assigned to the setting. Types of settings include common terminology, default specifications for information that is displayed, system URLs, and specifications for enabling or disabling various form features such as whether or not certain fields are visible within the form.</p>
        <p>Agency involvement varies depending upon the setting. Some settings are purely informational, and changes will not impact application functionality. Agency members may change these settings as necessary. For example, “App.Agency.Name” affects the name of the agency as it appears throughout the application.</p>
        <p>Other application settings affect the functioning of the system and should be changed only following careful consideration. For example, changes made to “URL for include file for Goals and Services on IL Plan” affects the structure and organization of the goals and services on the IL Service Plan. If an incorrect URL is entered, the form may not load correctly.</p>
        <p>Libera recommends that users only change application settings with appropriate knowledge of the setting, or with specific instructions from the Libera.</p>

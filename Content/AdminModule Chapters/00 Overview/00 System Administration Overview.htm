        <h1>System Administration Overview</h1>
        <p>The System 7™ Framework provides administrative tools that allow users to easily configure key aspects of the application. The System Administration Module is accessible to any user with a System Administrator, Application Administrator, or Technical Support role, and enables appropriate members of an organization to change system settings and manage crucial configuration data.</p>
        <p>This document provides an overview of available options and how they affect the system as a whole. It also explains which options organization members are encouraged to use and which options are best left for use by the Application Developers. </p>
        <p class="LIB_Note"><span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span> This guide is all inclusive and not all options discussed may be applicable to your agency.</p>

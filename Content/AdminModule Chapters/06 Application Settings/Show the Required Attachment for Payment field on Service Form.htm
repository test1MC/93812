        <p>Controls the <span class="LIB_Bold">Required Attachments for Payment</span> field appearing or not appearing on the <MadCap:variable name="FormNames.405" class="LIB_Italic" /> form. This is a lookup field where you can select one or more document categories. </p>
        <p class="LIB_Note"><span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span> This Application Setting is used in conjunction with the <span class="LIB_Italic">Show the Category lookup on attachments</span> Application Setting. Both must be set to true in order to work correctly.</p>
        <p>When the Value is set to true, at least one document must be attached to the Authorization form with the specified document category or categories filled in prior to opening the <span class="LIB_Italic">Payment Approval</span> form. If the user attempts to process a payment approval (for a full or partial payment) without the required attachment(s) on file, the following message appears.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>An attachment with the category of (X) is required before making a payment on this authorization.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>This message repeats for each required attachment category until all are attached to the Authorization form before allowing the user to open the <span class="LIB_Italic">Payment Approval</span> form.</p>

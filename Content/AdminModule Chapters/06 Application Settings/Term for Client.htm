        <p>This is the terminology your Agency uses for your clients. Enter the terminology your Agency uses in the Value field at the top of the form. Forms that use this variable will use the term you entered instead of the word 'client'. Use the <span class="LIB_Italic">Extended Settings</span> section of the form if different programs and/or forms use different terminology for 'client'. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="../01 General/02 Application Setting Form.htm">Application Setting Form</MadCap:xref> for additional information on using Extended Settings.</p>

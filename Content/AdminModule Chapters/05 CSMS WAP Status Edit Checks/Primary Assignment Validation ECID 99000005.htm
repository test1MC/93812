        <h1>Primary Assignment Validation ECID 99000005</h1>
        <p>This edit check checks for primary assignments at status changes throughout the life of the case. This edit check is related to the Application Setting, "<span class="LIB_Italic">Require the Program field to be filled in for Primary client assignments</span>". When set to true, then the Primary Assignment must have the primary assignment for that program for the date entered.</p>
        <p>If you want to change the this application setting, please contact Libera.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Additional Configuration Information</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="LIB_Note">Please note, you may review these settings but not change them. If you want them changed, please contact Libera.</span>

        <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Application Setting:</span> <span class="LIB_Italic">A Comma Separated List of Allowed Types of Primary Assignments</span></p>
        <p>This setting controls what assignment is required and is configurable by component. This setting stores a comma separated list of values. Possible values are 1, 2, or 3.</p>
        <p>1 = Require Primary Team Assignment</p>
        <p>2 = Require Primary Caseload Assignment</p>
        <p>3 = Require Primary Worker Assignment</p>
        <p>The 99999 extended system setting entry controls the primary assignment required when changing status. If the value of the system setting is set to a particular value, all other components will require that assignment based on the date that component was filed. Status 00 to 08 will not fire these checks.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Application Setting:</span> <span class="LIB_Italic">Forms that can be opened when the client does not have a primary assignment</span></p>
        <p>This setting controls what forms are allowed to be filed without a primary assignment.</p>

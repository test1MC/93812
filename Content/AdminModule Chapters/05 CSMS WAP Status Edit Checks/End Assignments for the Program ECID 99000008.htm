        <p>When the case closes for a program, this edit check adds an <span class="LIB_Bold">End Date</span> as of the closure status date for any active assignments for the client that are specifically for that program. Assignments without a program are left untouched. When this happens the following message appears:</p>
        <p><span class="LIB_Italic">An end date of (=closure status date for program) has been entered for the following assignments: (list of caseload(s), team(s), and/or worker(s) whose assignment has ended).</span>

        <h1>Example of ACL Effectiveness in Forms</h1>
        <p>Use of ACLs allows you control over which forms a user can see and use in System 7™.  You can use ACLs to limit access to a program specific to only users that work with that program.  Instead of wading through forms that a program X user would never use, they only see forms specific to program X.</p>
        <p>You can allow a program X form to be added new and edited by program X users and allow other users read-only access to the same form.  To do this you would make the <span class="LIB_Bold">Create ACL</span> and <span class="LIB_Bold">Write ACL</span> the same (User Roles for program X roles) and leave the <span class="LIB_Bold">Read ACL</span> blank.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Create ACL: 		23, 24, 1000-1010</p>
            <p>This allows users with roles 23, 24, and 1000 through 1010 to add this form to the ECF.</p>
            <p>Read ACL:</p>
            <p>Leaving this field blank allows all users to see the form in the ECF regardless of their user role.</p>
            <p>Write ACL: 			23, 24, 1000-1010</p>
            <p>This allows users with roles 23, 24, and 1000 through 1010 to open this form from the ECF and edit it.  This form is read-only to all other users.</p>

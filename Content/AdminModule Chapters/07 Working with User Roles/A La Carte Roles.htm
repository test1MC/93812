        <h1>A La Carte Roles</h1>
        <p>An "A La Carte" role is a role that gives a user access to specific functionality (form, PDQ, etc.) It is not a job title but an added function and is not intended to stand alone.</p>
        <p>For example let's say that there is a need to correct mistakes in closure data. However, the closure form locks on completion of data entry and you want to give only select staff rights to edit the data on the closed case. You would create a role that is allowed to edit the closure form at any time and then give that role to designated users in addition to their regular roles.</p>
        <p>Please note that simply creating a new role and assigning the role to an employee's <span class="LIB_Italic">Employee Information</span> form does not give the user the intended access. For example, if you want a user to be able to edit information on a form after the form has been signed, simply creating a role and assigning it to the user will not give them this ability.</p>
        <p>Further modifications to other areas of the system are needed. These areas of the system include, but are not limited to Application Settings, PDQ ACLs, Form ACLs, etc.</p>

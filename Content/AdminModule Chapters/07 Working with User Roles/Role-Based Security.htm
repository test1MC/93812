        <p>System 7™ is a role based case management system. Each user of the system is assigned one or more roles which allows them certain rights regarding various components and functionality. Rights might include users to perform certain actions, such as read/write data, access features, etc.  </p>
        <p>System 7 allows you to assign user rights to suit your Agency via the use of Access Control Lists (ACLs). ACLs are strings with extended syntax that identify which roles are allowed to access a specific feature. You create user roles and then assign them throughout the system.  User role creation and application of user roles is done in the System Administration module.</p>
        <p>ACL syntax is a simple comma-separated list of role specifiers. Four types of role specifiers are used in System 7, including explicit role, minimum role, exclude role, and role ranges. Each role specifier in the list is checked against all roles assigned to the user to see if it passes the check. If the user role passes any role specifier check, the user will have access.</p>
        <p>Newly created user roles are not effective until applied to all applicable areas of System 7.  This is done in the <span class="LIB_Italic">System Administration</span> module.</p>

            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Single Instance</span> - Allows the form to be added to the ECF multiple times or, not.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Days Between Instances</span> - Related to Single Instance, if multiple instances of a form are allowed this setting controls the frequency.</li>

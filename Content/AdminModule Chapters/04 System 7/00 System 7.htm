        <h1>System 7</h1>
        <p>The <span class="LIB_Italic">System 7</span> group handles many of the configuration settings of the framework. These options are typically more advanced and are used to configure the lower level operation of the application. These options must be configured or modified carefully, as incorrect settings may cause the application to stop working properly.</p>

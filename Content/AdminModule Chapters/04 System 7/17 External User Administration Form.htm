            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">First Name</span>, <span class="LIB_Bold">Last Name</span>, and <span class="LIB_Bold">Email</span> - These fields are populated based on the user's data entry via the Portal.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Username</span> - This is the name that the user uses when logging on to the system.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Set New Password</span> - Use this field to reset the user's password in the event they have forgotten their current password. Optionally, you may use the <span class="LIB_Bold">Create Password</span> button to automatically generate a new password. Setting a new password either way gives you the option to notify the user of their new password via email.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Password Never Expires</span> - When selected the password doesn't expire, this is not recommended. When blank, users are prompted upon first log on (or after their password is reset) to change their password. After that they will be prompted to change their password at the interval set by your Agency.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Last Login Date</span> - Displays the date the user last logged on to the system.</li>

            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Custom Login Message</span> - If the user is locked out (or terminated), this message is displayed on the login page. If the user is active, it is displayed upon log on to the system.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Reset User Security Questions</span> - Select this button to reset the User Security Questions for the user. When you do this, the next time the user logs on, they are required to select and answer new security questions.</li>

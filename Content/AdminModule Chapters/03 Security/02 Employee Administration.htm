        <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Description:</span> The <span class="LIB_Bold">Employee Administration</span> option allows  Administrators to track employees within an organization as well as other system users. This aids with both human resource records and establishing system security. Administrators can add new employees, terminate employees, change roles for employees with new job responsibilities, enter outside users as an employee (in order to assign them a user name and password), change the office assigned to the employee, and assign an employee to a caseload or team that has already been created.</p>
        <p>The <span class="LIB_Bold">Employee Administration</span> options displays a list of all currently active employees who have access to the system. An active employee is defined as an employee without a termination date in the past. Employees with termination dates of today or in the future will still appear in this table. </p>
        <p>Employees with termination dates before today appear in the <span class="LIB_Bold">Terminated Employees</span> option under <span class="LIB_Bold">Group: Security</span> within <span class="LIB_Italic">System Administration</span>. Selecting an employee record in the table opens the employee's <span class="LIB_Italic">Employee Information</span> form.</p>

        <p class="LIB_Note"><span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span>&#160;While you may edit data directly in the grid, it's easier to edit data via the <span class="LIB_Italic">Employee Information</span> form.</p>
        <p><span class="LIB_Bold">Description:</span> The <span class="LIB_Bold">Terminated Employees</span> option allows  Administrators to track employees within an organization as well as other system users. This aids with both human resource records and establishing system security. In the event of a rehire, Administrators can  clear the employee's termination date, change roles for employees with new job responsibilities,  change the office assigned to the employee, and assign an employee to a caseload or team that has already been created.</p>
        <p>The <span class="LIB_Bold">Terminated Employees</span> options displays a list of all currently terminated employees. A terminated employee is defined as an employee with a termination date in the past. Employees with termination dates of today or in the future will still appear in the <span class="LIB_Italic">Employee Administration</span> table. Selecting an employee record in the table opens the employee's <span class="LIB_Italic">Employee Information</span> form.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The <span class="LIB_Italic">Office Information</span> form is used to add offices and update office data as needed. Much of the information contained in this form flows forward into other forms as defined by your Agency. Additionally it's used to link district managers, vendors, and petty cash accounts to the office.</p>

        <p class="LIB_Bold">Form Fields</p>
        <p class="LIB_Note"><span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span> Each system may display slightly different fields, depending on the application configuration and system type. The fields on the <span class="LIB_Italic">Office Information</span> form can be made visible or be removed from by the  Administrator through settings in the <span class="LIB_Bold">Application Settings</span> option. As such, only the most common fields are defined below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Office Number</span> - You are prompted to add the <span class="LIB_Bold">Office Number</span> when you add a new office to the system. It must be two numbers and unique. If your Agency has two digit office numbers, the offices can be set up to match those, but this is not a requirement of the system.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Office Name</span> - Enter the name of the office into the Office Name field. What you enter will appear in form headers and other areas of the system that are configured to pull in this information. </li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">LOID</span> - Optional. An additional field used to pr. It accepts apha and numeric data entry.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">District/Agency Manager</span> - Use this field to link the office to a District Manager. Only employees with the user role of 1010 appear in the lookup/picklist for this field. If your Agency has configured the system to require the District Manager's signature for a specific form that an employee, who is linked to this office, is filling out, the employee listed as the District Manager for this office will be required to sign.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Vendor</span> - This field is multi-purpose as follows:<ol><li>When the agency provides a service, it is added to the vendor table. Then this field is used to link the office to the agency vendor. This in turn is tied to progress reports for tracking services provided internally by agency employees.</li><li>If your system has multiple sub-agencies that can approve vendors and/or services separately, the system refers to this field to determine which sub-agency the office belongs to.</li><li>When an agency uses outside vendors, the outside vendor is added to the vendor table. Then this field is used to link the outside vendor office to the outside vendor. This in turn is tied to progress reports for tracking on services provided by outside vendors.</li></ol></li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Office</span> and <span class="LIB_Bold">Contact Information</span> - Office address and contact information is frequently pulled into forms and letters.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Authorization Number</span> - Optional. This is a sequential number that is incremented every time an authorization is created for this office.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Warrant #/Voucher Sequence</span> - Optional. This is a sequential number that is incremented every time a warrant # is created for this office.</li>
            <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Invoice Number</span> - Optional. This is a sequential number that is incremented every time an invoice is created for this office.</li>

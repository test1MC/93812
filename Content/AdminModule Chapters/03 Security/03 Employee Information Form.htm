                <p>Much of data in this section pulls into other forms in the system or affects what data the employee may see.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Worker ID</span> - This is a unique identification "number" that appears in the client's <span class="LIB_Italic">Electronic Case Folder</span> (ECF) and depending on your Agency's application settings in <span class="LIB_Italic">Case Notes</span>. You may enter up to three alpha or numerical characters. This data is required when assigning employees to caseloads and teams.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Employee Name</span> and <span class="LIB_Bold">Title</span> - This information is often pulled into many different forms in the application. The employee's title does not designate their user role in the application.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Termination Date</span> - When an employee is terminated enter the date terminated here. You don't want to delete them from the application because their name and ID numbers are needed for historic reference.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Office </span>- This field is required. It links the employee to the office they work in which gives them access to the appropriate budget accounts and client data. Also associates them with a district/region. When the employee changes offices, update this field with the new office.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Supervisor</span> - Required. There is built in functionality within the system that calls to this information. For example a form that the employee opens and fills out may require a supervisor signature. The supervisor's name comes from this field. When an employee gets a new supervisor, update this field accordingly.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Phone, Fax, Cell, TTY, Email</span> - Depending on your Agency's settings some or all of this information may flow into form headers, form letters, and in signature sections of various forms.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Team to assign when adding a new client (If empty, employee will be assigned)</span> - Optional. When clients are added to the system, the employee who adds them automatically appears as a worker assignment in the case assignment section of the <span class="LIB_Italic">Demographic Information</span> form. Selecting a team from the lookup/picklist for this field, overrides the automatic worker assignment. Instead, the selected team automatically appears in the case assignment section of the <span class="LIB_Italic">Demographic Information</span> form.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Authorization Level</span> - This applies to the employee who writes the authorization. When used, it limits the maximum dollar amount the employee can authorize per authorization. To use this field, type up to eight numeric characters to represent a whole dollar amount. When you tab out of the field the dollar sign, commas, and decimal point appear automatically. Should the authorization amount be over the employee's limit, an additional signature line for the employee's supervisor is added to the authorization form.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Increase Authorizations</span> - This applies to the employee who writes the authorization. After the authorization is approved...<br /><br />... A <span class="LIB_Bold">N</span> (<span class="LIB_Italic">No</span>) response means that employee cannot go over the original approved amount.<br /><br />... A <span class="LIB_Bold">Y</span> (<span class="LIB_Italic">Yes</span>) or if the field is left blank, response means that they can go over by the percentage specified in the <span class="LIB_Bold">% Authorization Increase</span> field.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Require original signator to approve changes</span> - When marked <span class="LIB_Bold">Y</span> (<span class="LIB_Italic">Yes</span>) and the employee makes changes to an authorization after it is approved and those changes would cause an additional signature line to be added, this setting causes an additional signature line for the user who originally signed the authorization instead of the supervisor of the user that made the change.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Program</span> - Allows you to set authorization limits by program for the employee. All of the fields in the <span class="LIB_Italic">Authorization Limits</span> section are related to the program selected. If a program is not selected, the other fields are applied to all programs. <span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span> You may set authorization limits for multiple programs and <span class="LIB_Bold">Account Identifiers</span>.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Account Identifier</span> - Field opens for editing once a <span class="LIB_Bold">Program</span> is selected. Allows you to specify an Account Identifier for the selected program. This affects the account selection process on <span class="LIB_Italic">Authorization</span> forms.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">% Authorization Increase</span> - This applies to the employee who writes the authorization. Use this in conjunction with the <span class="LIB_Bold">Increase Authorizations</span> field. <span class="LIB_Bold">Note:</span> if the response to Increase Authorizations is No, entering a value into this field will not change anything. Type a numeric value between .01 and 1000 for the percent.<br /><br />After the authorization is approved and the employee is allowed to increase the authorization amount, the employee may increase the amount of the authorization by the percent entered.<br /><br />For example, if the original approved amount of the authorization was $1,000.00, and the employee's increase authorization percentage is 10%, the maximum amount the authorization could be increased to is $1,100.00.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Amount Authorization Increase</span> - You may allow authorization increases by percentage <span class="LIB_Bold">OR</span> specific amount, not both. When you limit by amount, the employee may only increase authorizations up to the amount entered and only if the response to <span class="LIB_Bold">Increase Authorizations?</span> is <span class="LIB_Bold">Y</span> (<span class="LIB_Italic">Yes</span>).</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Required Role</span> - When filled in, an additional signature line appears on authorization forms for users with this role instead of the employee's direct supervisor when the employee reaches his/her authorization limits.</li>
                    <li><span class="LIB_Bold">Yearly Authorization Limit</span> - This applies to the employee requesting the authorization. When used, it limits the maximum dollar amount the employee can authorize per year. To use this field, type up to eight numeric characters to represent a whole dollar amount. When you tab out of the field the dollar sign, commas, and decimal point appear automatically. Employees will not be able to write any authorizations when their yearly authorization limit is met.</li>

                <p>You may add as many user rate sections as needed. Enter user rates if this employee provides services for the agency. The fields in this section allow you to specify the rate and the account the funds should come out of based on the values entered for program, account identifier, and special project.</p>
